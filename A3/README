I did not complete question 2b.

Instruction:

ccadd - argument (ccadd id maker model year cpu desc), ccadd allows users to create new content.

ccitem - argument (ccitem id), find the item by its id. It prints an error message if id doesn't exist.

cclist - argument (cclist), prints everythin in the db.

ccdel - argument (ccdel id), find the id, and delete it from db. It prints an error message if id doesn't exist.

ccmatch - argument (ccmatch string). It takes an input string and matches it with the maker, model, and desc. 
It is case sensitive and matches the same string with the input string. 
For example: if desc has "Intel i3-1333 2-Core Processor", the input must be the same to find it in desc attribute.

ccyear - argument (ccyear year1 year2). ccyear takes 2 years input command line arguments. 
years1 cannot greater than year2 and year2 cannot less than year1. It prints valid year between year1 and year2.

ccedit - argument (ccedit id). ccedit takes id as input command line arguments and retrieves the specified item. 
It prompts a yes and no question if user want to change the data. It displays the number menu. The user has the option to choose which attribute to modify. 
If user input no, the program will exist.
